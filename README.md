## User Experience (UX)

This project is aimed at perfume lovers and beginners who want a **fast, text-based tool** to store perfume details, **search/filter** by notes or brand, and get **simple recommendations** without needing a database or website.

AromaVault writes to local JSON files by default, and can **import/export CSV**, making it easy to move data in and out.

### User Stories

*First-time user goals*
  * Understand what the tool does and how to run it from the terminal.
  * Add a new perfume with basic fields (name, brand, notes, price).
  * See a list of perfumes and search by notes or brand.
  * Export data to CSV for use elsewhere.

*Returning user goals*
  * Update price or notes on an existing item.
  * Import a CSV file of items and avoid manual entry.
  * Create a simple **profile** and get **recommendations** within a budget.

* **List** and **Search** (brand, notes, price cap)  
* **Import CSV / Export CSV** (ids supported for upsert)  
* **Profiles**: store preferences (preferred/avoid notes, brand bias, price_max)  
* **Recommend**: a tiny, deterministic scoring to return top-k matches  
* **Friendly errors** and safe file I/O (no crashes on missing files)

### Features Left To Implement

* Optional fuzzy search toggle and better ranking explanations  
* More advanced profile fields (season, longevity, occasion)  
* CSV schema validation with a helpful report

## Design

* **Simple, readable CLI** output using sensible defaults.  
* **Minimal data model**:
  * Perfume: `id`, `name`, `brand`, `notes` (list of strings), `price` (number).
  * Profile: `id`, `preferred_notes`, `avoid_notes`, `brand_bias`, `price_max`.

## Testing

Automated tests verify a few CLI behaviors and basic storage/recommendation logic. Manual tests confirm friendly error messages and CSV flows.

Run locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
